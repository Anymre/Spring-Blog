Ruben Garcia from Annunciation House in El Paso told CBS News that 522 migrants were released Wednesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at sites in El Paso and Las Cruces, New Mexico. That raises the total number of people released this week to more than 1,000 after 186 people were released on Christmas Day and 400 were released in the two days before Christmas.   Garcia said there could be another 500 released on Thursday, "It should be organized and orderly as it was today," Garcia said.   Local nonprofit groups told the CBS affiliate KBDC the key difference from earlier in the week was that they were notified in advance of Tuesday's mass release by ICE, something the groups and U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who represents El Paso, said didn't happen previously.  As a result, the nonprofits were a bit more prepared for the large influx.  Day three of mass releases by ICE in #ElPaso. On this #Christmas day these three boys are enjoying some sweets. Their parents gave us permission to take their pictures. So far about 160 have been brought here.

The situation is really difficult for them," said Dylan Corbett, executive director of the Hope Border Institute.
